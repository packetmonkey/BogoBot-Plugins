These are extra plugins for BogoBot not included in the BogoBot distro.

These plugins are either more 'advanced' than what I wanted to put into
the bot distro or are just kinda fringe, niche needs, or just silly.

Plugins
#######

QuoteDB
-------
Allows the saving of quotes from chat. Typically, we have used
this for out of context quotes in our channel. We have defacto
tags, such as (Overheard) or (IM) if the quote is from outside
of IRC. This version use ActiveRecord and SQLite3, so you need
those gems installed.

BitlyUrl
--------
Watched for URLs in chat, and if they are over a certain length,
then it's send off to bit.ly to get a short version which is then
displayed in chat. Mostly useful for those of us who use text
based IRC clients like irssi or wee-chat.

This plugin requires you to obtain your own bit.ly login and API
key, but those cost nothing 'cept a little time in signing up on
http://bit.ly
