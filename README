These are extra plugins for BogoBot not included in the BogoBot distro.

These plugins are either more 'advanced' than what I wanted to put into
the bot distro or are just kinda fringe, niche needs, or just silly.

Plugins
-------

QuoteDB -- allows the saving of quotes from chat. Typically, we have used
           this for out of context quotes in our channel. We have defacto
           tags, such as (Overheard) or (IM) if the quote is from outside
           of IRC. This version use ActiveRecord and SQLite3, so you need
           those gems installed.
